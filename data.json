  "about": "Hi! I'm Mcneil. \n \nI'm a backend developer specializing in Java and Node.js, with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable, and secure server-side applications. I enjoy tackling complex problems and designing systems that perform seamlessly behind the scenes. \n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring vast virtual worlds — I’m a big fan of open-world games, where I can dive into new adventures and uncover hidden details, much like I do in code.",
