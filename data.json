  "about": "Hi! I'm Mcneil. \n \nI'm a full-stack developer who specializes in backend development, with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable, and secure server-side applications. I love tackling complex problems and designing systems that run smoothly behind the scenes while ensuring a seamless experience on the front end. \n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me immersed in survival and puzzle games — I enjoy the challenge of strategic thinking and problem-solving, whether it’s surviving in a digital wilderness or cracking intricate puzzles.",
